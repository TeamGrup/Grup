<!-- THINGS NEEDED
1. Description - Description of the game, influences from history or other games on you as
	a designer that led to this game, what is unique about the game, and major features of
	the game. You may also want to list Platforms, Rating, Launch Date and other highlights.
2. Development Log - Dated entries indicating the status of the project. It must include 1)
	what has been recently completed 2) what each person is currently working on 3) what
	features/ideas or on the backlog are to be done next 4) Analysis of playtesting (probably
	as a separate page) 5) Obstacles that are blocking development 6) Reflection on game
	and process. What is working, what is not working. This represents your
	work-in-progress. Do not backdate any items. If you forget to report a playtesting session
	that happened a month ago, enter it as a new entry for today and indicate you are
	reporting on an older playtest.
3. Playable Game - A WebGL build of the game that can be played in the browser.
	Optionally you may want to include Windows, Mac or other executables.
4. Playtesting Reports - At least three sets of playtesting reports showing how the game
	was playtested and what decisions were reached. The playtests need to happen at
	different development phases. The final playtest should include description of the last set
	of changes you plan to make to the game as well as recommendations for future extensions 
	that you did not get to implement.
5. Credits - Names of team members and their primary roles, possibly a contact email for
	the team
6. References - Each piece of asset in the game (each image, model, texture, sound,
	script, etc) that you did not produce yourself needs to be documented. You can
	reference Unity Standard Assets
	https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/asset-packs/standard-assets-32351
	and Unity Playground assets
	https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/unity-playground-1099
	17 as one item, but anything beyond that has to be documented individually. This means
	you should not import an "asset package" with 100+ assets, but selectively import assets
	one-by-one. You must have the rights to use the assets in your game, so no commercial
	songs or images. Do not purchase any assets. This is a class project, design within the
	constraints.
7. Trailer - A 30-60 trailer for your game on https://www.twitch.tv/ The video should not be
	the first 30 seconds of your game, but interesting segments from the game. Optionally,
	you can include a longer, up to 10 minute, overview of your game.
8. Screenshots - 5 screenshots that is representative of your game.
9. Source Code - Source code for your game. Include a Readme.txt file with your source
	code indicating which version of Unity you have used and the URL to your game's
	website.
10. Game Presentation - A copy of your final presentation that you presented on demo-day.
	The presentation should be a maximum of 5 slides.
12. Team Reflection - Reflect on your process as well as answering the following questions:
	What is the one thing your team did really well? What evidence can you show for it? If
	you had another 2-weeks to work on the game, what would be the 3 highest priority
	items. 1-2 paragraphs
