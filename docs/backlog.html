			<h1> HOW GRUP WAS MADE </h1>
			<p id="subtitle"> Grup was developed over multiple weeks, with multiple revisions. 
			Below depicts our progress throughout this quarter. </p>

			<div class="header">Doing the Work</div>
			<div class="description">
			<p>We started with a brainstorm session and a <a href="https://trello.com/b/uTCqzXIR/grup-board">Trello Kanban board</a>. The next step was
			setting up our <a href="https://github.com/TeamGrup/Grup">source control repo</a> on Github. After that, we started talking about our ideas.  We came up with concepts
			that we wanted to explore and test in Unity to see the feasiblity of being able to complete the work in the time allotted for the quarter.</p>			
			<p>We attempted to do an Agile sprint style design, but honestly, it just devolved into getting our assigned work done and picking up whatever we needed
			to in order to ensure we met deadlines and had a polished product.  In that case, we were extremely lucky in having a very balanced team.  We have someone who
			has spent a lot of time working with Unity, artists, an experienced coder, and someone who would keep us on track; the team balance was excellent for short-term
			project.</p>
			<img class="vine" src="vineLong.png">
			<p>Next up was the Alpha Test. This is where we put our prototype ideas together for the first time and got to see the beginnings of our game.
			It may have just been colored blocks and Grup, but it was playable and we saw our concepts come to life. We created a couple levels and let our classmates
			give it a run! We took this information from their feedback and continued to refine the game.</p>
			<p>These refinements plus more of the features and art we had finished became our Beta Test. We got over 20 people to run through the beta version of Grup
			and give us feedback, and give us feedback they did.  We got lots of good feedback about the playability and feel of the game, but we'll go over that below
			in the "Playtesting" section.  We took this information and polished the game even more and presented our pre-release version to the class and it was a hit.</p>
			<img class="vine" src="vineLong.png">
			<p>And that's where we are... we would love to keep adding to Grup and we just might. We would like to keep refining it and complete the vision we had at the 
			start of this. In the meantime, please enjoy the current released version of Grup and we hope it provides you with entertainment and some fun.  -- Team Grup</p>
